- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It makes the code more flexible I guess. I feel more easier when using them. I did not really check FuelType before typing in Engine, so I did some extra work. I really don't have many advice. One thing I can say is to start ahead so that if you encounter any problem then you can ask people with it.
